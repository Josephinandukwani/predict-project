# Project README

## Introduction
In this project, i aim to explore the pricing data of various vegetables in order to gain insights into their market trends and behavior. To begin, we import the necessary libraries and data, and then clean and inspect the data to ensure its quality and suitability for analysis. We create a copy of the dataframe as a checkpoint, and then change the data types to be more suitable for our analysis objectives. Next, we conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain a deeper understanding of the data.

## Problem Statement
The problem statement is to analyze the pricing data of various vegetables and identify the key patterns and trends. The dataset contains information about the prices of different vegetable types, including Bhindi (Ladies finger), Tomato, Onion, Potato, Brinjal, Garlic, Peas, Methi, Green Chilli, and Elephant Yam (Suran). The analysis aims to answer questions such as:

- What is the distribution of prices for each vegetable type?
- Are there any outliers in the data?
- Which vegetable types have a higher average price?
- Are there any patterns or trends in the data that can be used to make informed decisions?

## Methods used
- EDA
- Data visualisation

## Technologies used
- Visual studio code
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Numpy
- Seaborn

## 1. Import and Cleaning
### 1.1 Library and Data Import
The first step is to import our libraries (pandas, numpy, seaborn and matplotlib.pyplot to begin with) and read the CSV file containing our vegetables pricing data into a pandas DataFrame.
